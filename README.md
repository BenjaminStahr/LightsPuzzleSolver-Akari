# LightsPuzzleSolver-Akari

Akari is a logic puzzle game. One has to place light bulbs in a grid and has to light up all fiels. A light bulb always just lights up its 
corresponding horizontal and vertical line. There are walls on the map, which block the light. Some walls have a number, which specify
how many light bulbs have to surround it. 

In this repository a informed depth search is implemented, which can solve light puzzles up to a dimension of 28x28 or sometimes higher.
